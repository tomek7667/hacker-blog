If you want to propagate certain fields to children issues of an epic, select 3 dots of an epic an click `Propagate selected fields to children`. If you don't see this option, contact your jira administrator, as the extension is probably not installed.

If a window opens with fields that are available to be propagated, select the ones you want to propagate down the children issue, and click `Propagate` button.

If you see any kind of error, please feel free to use my [contact form](https://rachunki2.cyber-man.pl/) where I will be happy to help resolve any issues.
