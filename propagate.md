# Propagate for Jira – User Guide

## Streamlining Field Consistency Across Issues

Propagate empowers teams to enhance operational efficiency by ensuring consistent field values across hierarchically related issues. This functionality is particularly valuable for aligning child issues under a common strategic context defined at the epic level.

## How to Use Propagate

To initiate field propagation from an Epic to its associated child issues, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the desired **Epic** in your Jira project.
2. Click on the **More actions** menu (the three-dot icon) located in the Epic's toolbar.
3. Select the option: **Propagate selected fields to children**.

> **Note:** If this option is not visible, please reach out to your **Jira Administrator** to confirm that the Propagate extension has been properly installed and configured within your environment.

## Selecting Fields for Propagation

Once the propagation interface is displayed:

- Review the list of available fields eligible for propagation.
- Select the fields you wish to cascade down to all associated child issues.
- Click the **Propagate** button to apply your selections.

This action ensures that key data points remain aligned across your issue hierarchy, promoting better reporting accuracy and cross-team transparency.
